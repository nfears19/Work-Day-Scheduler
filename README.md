#Work Day Scheduler

#Description
This repository contains my work day scheduler that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. This project was a homework assignment from the Case Western Reserve Univeristy's Coding Bootcamp.
